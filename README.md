## Statement of Purpose

As part of ITP’s new undergraduate program, Interactive Media Arts (IMA) which launched in Fall 2018, this course will provide a foundation for understanding modern web development with a focus on front end technologies and accessing public data. The forms and uses of these technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation and discussion. This studio stresses interactivity, usability, and the quality and appropriateness of look and feel.

While this course is geared towards Tisch IMA students it will be open to all NYU students pending space and prerequisites.  Aside from Tisch IMA students, this course will particularly benefit students who are studying away in NY from our sibling program IMA in Shanghai and Interactive Media in Abu Dhabi among other NYU students.

## Course Description

This course will provide a foundation for understanding modern web development with a focus on front end technologies and accessing public data. The forms and uses of these technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation and discussion. This studio stresses interactivity, usability, and the quality and appropriateness of look and feel.

Students will create two web applications, including one that leverages public APIs and Javascript libraries. The goal of the course is for students to learn how to think holistically about an application, both by designing a clear user experience and understanding the algorithmic steps required to build it. Assignments are arranged in sequence to enable the production of a website of high quality in design and engineering.

### Teaching Style 

Classes will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, hands-on tutorials, homework review, presentations, and group work.  You will need to come to class prepared with a laptop and any other supplies specified for that class.

### Course Schedule

The course will be one (1) time per week for three hours (5:20) for a total of 15 weeks.  

### Learning Objectives

At the completion of this course, the student will:

* Know how to design, build, and develop content for a professional-quality website.
* Understand and implement the iterative design and development process
* Learn how to proactively learn, also known as self-regulated learning. In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.
* Create an internal developer / creative community

### Course Content Overview

User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)

* HTML5 / CSS3
* The Responsive Web (flexible media & media queries)
* Javascript, Javascript Libraries + Frameworks
* Using Public Data via APIs

### Equipment

You will need a modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb).  Limited numbers are available for checkout from the department.  Commercial software required in the course will be made available on the laptops available for checkout.  Other required software is freely available.

### Software

All software required for the course is freely available

* Browser: Chrome or Firefox
* Github Account: github.com/join
* Developer Tools for Chrome or Firefox
  * Firebug for Firefox, http://getfirebug.com/ or
  * Chrome Developer Tools, https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools
* HTML Text Editor (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets.io, etc)
* Web Server Space
  * We will be using Github Pages to host your websites, but you are welcome to purchase your own server space as well.

## Grading and Attendance

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

### Regular Assignments 30%

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. Most assignments will include a Learning Log, where you will be asked to provide some assessment of your clarity on a topic after doing a tutorial. Please write on your Learning Logs (a personal blog or documentation). You can create your logs on Github, Notion, Wordpress, even Google docs, if you prefer. Here are some things to include in your weekly logs:
* Identify (name, URL, sections, etc.) at least one tutorial that you did, and respond to the following.
* Instances where you achieved clarity, i.e. understood something or felt pieces of knowledge falling into place towards a greater understanding.
* Instances where you did NOT achieve clarity and why. What can you do to aid your understanding?
* Connections you made among the week’s readings, lectures, class activities, homework assignments, etc.
* Links to any web page, source code or layout files you created (Codepen, Figma, Github, P5 Editor, etc.).

Each assignment is due by the next class meeting after they are assigned unless stated otherwise. It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

### Mid-Term Project 20%

The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge of website design and responsive HTML & CSS. This project must be completed, published, and presented.

### Participation 20%
This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This is 20% of your overall grade. Each student will be asked to do a 5-min presentation on a Learning Log throughout the semester, which is part of your participation grade.

I am committed to facilitating the fullest possible participation of all my students. Acknowledging that being present is a form of participation in itself, and that engaged listening is not a passive form of participation either, I welcome my students to communicate with me what kinds of engagement are best for them so I can take that into account. I will provide clear expectations and examples around participation to help ensure everyone’s voice has a place in this space.

Examples of modes of participation can look like: asking questions, going to office hours, sending and reading emails, class group discussion, arriving on time, going to class, taking notes, listening to peers, submitting responses to a form (anonymous or not), following instructions, active listening, etc.

### Final Project 20%

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks. This project must be completed, published, and presented.

### Documentation/Tickets to Leave 10%

5% - Students will be expected to document their work on Github. This will involve regular publishing of source code and assignments, using comments and README files as necessary. (Github will be a topic we cover in class.)

5% - At the end of each session, students will need to submit a Ticket to Leave to the class Slack.
* List at least 1 thing you learned today in class.
* What concept(s) confuses you from today’s lecture, discussion, or exercises? (This will give you a clue as to what you should study before the next class.)

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

### Attendance
There are no excused absences and unexcused absences. There are only absences. You can have 4 amount of absences without your grade being affected. A passing grade requires at least 50% attendance. 2 late arrivals (more than 10 minutes after start time) will count as 1 absence.
For example, 4 absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A.

Optional makeup work statement: While there is no distinction in this course between excused and unexcused absences, you may inquire with me about makeup work if you have more than 4 absences. Makeup work may be content you can consume, having a conversation with someone in class, additional office hours, writing a paper or an additional project. Not all course content can be made up. Please clarify with your instructor.

### Grade Overview

#### A. Excellent (90-100)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

#### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

#### C. Satisfactory (70-79)

Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

#### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)

Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

#### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)

Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.

## Electronics Use

Recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems and other devices are forbidden. Laptops and tablets are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. 

## Diverse Perspectives and Learning Modes
Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and require different kinds of accommodations. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you in any way, I invite you to communicate this with me. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

## Open Office Hours
You all enter this classroom with different sets of skills. In virtue of this fact, I open my office to you as an extension of the classroom. I am available for you during that time and if you can’t make it to the scheduled times, you are welcome to [make an appointment with me at any time](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ3NlqHFyNZHQO9K9PCrCzhRv5-F5FYAaMyMtiyWD41lBhQ5yNFdUs9PTNpN779gOEoVfNfCbgEK). There’s no incorrect way to approach office hours, and they can be as formal or informal as you would like. In this class, we will not shy away from difficult conversations and work closely together to cultivate a space of openness and mutual support. I welcome you to contact me outside of class and office hours. You may email me, call me, or schedule an appointment.

 ## Incompletes
Incomplete grades may only be given to students who have completed more than half of the class assignments. Incomplete grades are given at the discretion of the professor since managing incomplete grades is often additional uncompensated labor for the instructor.

## Extensions
An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an extension, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do not request an extension, the grading rules above apply.

## Communication
You must check your email (or other stated class form of communication) for important updates about class.

## Statement Of Academic Integrity
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.
Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.
