# API's and Handling DATA (CSV)

## Topic:

Fetch. [What is an API?](https://medium.com/@perrysetgo/what-exactly-is-an-api-69f36968a41f). Parsing CSV: [Data World](https://data.world/).

## Activities:

* How Many People Are In Space Right Now? [API URL](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json)
* Wikipedia search* [API URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&format=json&search=query)

### Assignment:

Prepare a presentation for your Final Project idea. Your presentation should be shareable. Include a moodboard, site map, and wireframes. The final assignment is similar to the midterm in that you are expected to have a complete idea and a reason for why you want to make this. You are responsible for making a web application that is thoughtfully designed and built for a responsive experience and utilizes at least one API to populate data or introduce a service to your app. This API can be from a content management system (CMS) powering a personal portfolio. You are allowed to continue work on your midterm project (but I expect to see a significant update) or pivot to a new idea.
