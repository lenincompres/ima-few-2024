  * Accessible design principles (e.g., color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
  * Screen readers demo.
  * Tools and techniques for evaluating and improving website accessibility.
    * Heading order
    * HTML lang
    * Heading order
    * Contrast
    * Alt-text
    * Accessible fonts
    * Text in images!

   * **WebAIM - Keyboard Accessibility** : Learn to make websites fully operable via keyboard.

#### **Activity** :

1. **Lecture and Discussion** :
   * Discuss why digital accessibility matters and review real-life examples of accessible vs. inaccessible websites.
   * Explore WCAG standards and the legal implications of non-compliance.
2. **Hands-On Workshop** :
   * **Accessibility Audit** : Pair up with a classmate to conduct an audit of an existing website (e.g., a popular e-commerce site) using WAVE and Axe tools.
   * **Report Findings** : Identify specific accessibility issues (e.g., missing alt text, low contrast, keyboard traps) and suggest improvements.
   * **Remediation Exercise** : Each team picks two or three accessibility issues to fix on a simple HTML/CSS page.
3. **Reflection and Learning Log** :
   * Add entries on accessibility concepts learned, audit findings, and reflections on the importance of inclusive design.
