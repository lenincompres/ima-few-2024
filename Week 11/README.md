# Project proposals and Digital Accessibility

## Part 1: Digital Accessibility

* **Objective** : Understand digital accessibility and learn how to create inclusive websites that accommodate all users, including those with disabilities.
* **Key Concepts** :
  * Introduction to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
  * Accessible design principles (e.g., color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
  * Screen readers demo.
  * Tools and techniques for evaluating and improving website accessibility.
    * Heading order
    * HTML lang
    * Heading order
    * Contrast
    * Alt-text
    * Accessible fonts
    * Text in images!

### **Resources** :

1. **Readings and Guidelines** :
   * [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
   * [Accessible Design Principles by A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)
     * [Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
2. **Tools** :
   * **WAVE Accessibility Evaluation Tool** : Test sites for accessibility compliance.
   * **Axe Chrome Extension** : Browser tool to analyze accessibility issues.
   * **Color Contrast Checker** : Ensure text and background colors meet WCAG contrast standards.
     * [RandomA11y](https://randoma11y.com/)
   * [Inclusive-Components](https://inclusive-components.design/)
3. **Tutorials** :
   * **Mozilla - Accessibility** : Guide on implementing accessibility in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   * **WebAIM - Keyboard Accessibility** : Learn to make websites fully operable via keyboard.

### **Activity** :

1. **Lecture and Discussion** :
   * Discuss why digital accessibility matters and review real-life examples of accessible vs. inaccessible websites.
   * Explore WCAG standards and the legal implications of non-compliance.
2. **Hands-On Workshop** :
   * **Accessibility Audit** : Pair up with a classmate to conduct an audit of an existing website (e.g., a popular e-commerce site) using WAVE and Axe tools.
   * **Report Findings** : Identify specific accessibility issues (e.g., missing alt text, low contrast, keyboard traps) and suggest improvements.
   * **Remediation Exercise** : Each team picks two or three accessibility issues to fix on a simple HTML/CSS page.
3. **Reflection and Learning Log** :
   * Add entries on accessibility concepts learned, audit findings, and reflections on the importance of inclusive design.

## Part 2: Project Proposals

Each student will have 5 minutes to explain their idea (or ideas) for the final project.
  *  What would you like to accomplish?
  *  What Were your inspirations?
  *  Share your design (UX/UI) ideas: moodboard, sitemap, wireframes.
  *  What API, data, and resources would you incorporate?

# Assigment

  * Revisit your midterm project, and audit them using AXE, WAVE, or other accessibility tools. Document the issues you found and how did you address them. Share your revised project version and document it on your learning logs.
