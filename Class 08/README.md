## HOMEWORK
In [The Javascript Way](https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway)
* Read Chapter 9 - 10. Complete the exercises only or Chapter 9. Submit a code pen link.
* Review Chapters 13 - 16 (no need to turn in the assignments but you should attempt them anyway)
* Coding exercise:
  * Begin by creating an HTML document that has at least 10 of the same HTML elements.
  * Wrap some of these inside of <div> tags. Assign an ID to at least two of your <div> tags.
  * Build three buttons that will run a function on click.
  * Add three empty divs to the bottom of your page with unique IDs.
  * Now, create at least three functions that will run on click:
    * How many of the same HTML elements are on the page. (For example, if you included 10 <p> tags, it should return a statement that says something like, "There are 10 paragraph tags on this page.")
    * How many elements are inside of your first ID
    * How many elements are inside of your second ID
    * Each function should update one of the three empty divs with this information
  * Submit a link to your GITHUB Rep by the start of our next class Thursday.
