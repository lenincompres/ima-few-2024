  * Accessing DOM element
    * defer, ids, appendChild
    * content: innerHTML, innerText
    * events: onclick
    * classes: classList
    * style: color
  * Object methods
    * cardArray.sort()
    * cardArray.slice()
    * Math.random()
  * Classes
    * constructor, methods: card.flip()
    * static properties
    * module, import
    * properties: isFace
  * Asynchronous functions
    * setTimeOut
    * async, await

## HOMEWORK
* Assignment: your choice!
  * Create your own playground with at least 5 DOM elements, 3 listeners (onclick, onchange, etc.) and 2 functions besides initialization (set up). Link to your Github Repo AND Github Pages URL.
  * Or, create a single web page that uses AJAX (fetch);  to load and display data from one of The New York Times APIs. Your page should also include at least one form of "user interaction".
  * Bonus: Use Github Desktop to create a new branch in your midterm project. Link to the branch's Github Repo.
* Prepare a presentation for your Final Project idea. Your presentation should be shareable. Include a moodboard, site map, and wireframes. The final assignment is similar to the midterm in that you are expected to have a complete idea and a reason for why you want to make this. You are responsible for making a web application that is thoughtfully designed and built for a responsive experience and utilizes at least one API to populate data or introduce a service to your app. This API can be from a content management system (CMS) powering a personal portfolio. You are allowed to continue work on your midterm project (but I expect to see a significant update) or pivot to a new idea.
