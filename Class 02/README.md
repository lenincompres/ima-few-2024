# Part 2 - Design
* UX Exercise review

  * Exchange wireframes and site maps
  * With no verbal explanation on your team's part, have the other team describe what a user journey would look like based on the site you created
  * Fill in the gaps on anything they got wrong. What, if anything, is confusing about your wireframes?
  * Discuss why you chose the content you included on the homepage and what you left out
  * Repeat with the other team's drawings

## Homework
* Finish your in-class assignment. If your wireframe and sitemap are hand drawn, be sure to scan them or take a photo of them. Be prepared to present your idea in class and explain your choices.
* Starting with the wireframe you already created, make a mock up of your Craigslist homepage redesign complete with all visual design. Please use software to generate your mockup as a jpg, pdf, or png (several options are posted above but you may use anything you like)
