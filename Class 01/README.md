# Part 1

## Introductions

Go over syllabus & class requirements. This is a contract between students + professor, so it is important we're all on the same page!

## Learning Goals

* Why am I in this class? Why NOW?
* What do I hope I will learn? What are my goals?
* What content do I think will help me accomplish my learning goals?

## Lecture: What is Web Development?

## In class assignment

Work with a partner and create a new pen at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) Add HTML to the pen that includes:

* A DOCTYPE tag
* An html tag
* A head
  * Include a title and meta tag for the viewport
* A body
  * In the body, add a large heading that acts as a headline that declares your favorite restaurant
  * Below this large heading, add a smaller sub-heading that tells the user a bold statement about this restaurant
  * Include sensational paragraph text that tells a fictional 3-4 sentence story about this restaurant.
  * Add a ridiculous image of a food item that this restaurant sells. Note, you will need to find an image on the internet and link to its URL.
  * Somewhere on the page, include a link to an external website. Make sure that link opens in a new tab or window. Bonus: Embed that link in the image.
  * Before you leave, make sure both students have a link to the codepen to revisit it after class

# Homework

* Let's get inspired! Start finding creative portfolios, cool interactive experiences, or perfectly polished websitesâ€”whatever makes you excited about learning front-end development. Be prepared to give a 2-3 min presentation to the class on the work that you found (do some research into its origins) and why you're interested in it.
* Complete a Learning Log this week that will help you begin to learn the introductory concepts of HTML and CSS. Here are some resources:
  * [Khan Academy - Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)
  * [Codecademy - Make A Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website)

  * [25 HTML and CSS Tutorials on Codeburst](https://codeburst.io/25-html-css-tutorials-6a864f387185)
* Join
  * Use ITP/IMA's pronunciation tool [Say My Name](https://stu.itp.nyu.edu/saymyname)
  * Join [Github](https://github.com/)
* Download a code editor of your choice (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets.io, etc)
  * In your code editor, create a new file named index.html. Take the code you created in class and copy and paste it into this file. Using [this as an example](https://codepen.io/callihiggins/pen/jOEjrPQ), add a Nav bar to your page that makes sense with the context of your restaurant's page. At the moment, it will just look like a bulleted list- thats ok! We'll make it look like a nav bar next week with css. Turn in this file in via NYU classes.
